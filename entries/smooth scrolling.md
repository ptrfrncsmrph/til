Browser's automatic scrolling behavior has traditionally been very jumpy, with
developers needing to write custom JavaScript code to simulate a smooth scroll.
However thanks to the [smooth scrolling] specification, browsers over the years
have adopted an API for CSS and JavaScript to natively smooth scroll.

For navigating to a specific page location using [`window.scrollTo()`] or
similar methods, provide an options object instead of explicit coordinates.

```js
// Old way
window.scrollTo(0, 100);

// Smooth way
window.scrollTo({ top: 100, behavior: "smooth" });
```
